So I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Mountainhead, and, jeez, it’s like eating a sandwich with too many pickles: I’m not sure what exactly I bit into. First off, can we talk about how the mountain itself isn’t even the main character? Come on, give me more rock action. I went in expecting Everest meets Shakespeare — but ended up with something more like if you threw a bunch of action figures into a blender with a half-written poetry book.

I walked out of the theater kind of in a daze, you know? It’s a  , I guess, for those who think staring at a rock for two hours is like gazing deep into the human soul. Okay, maybe that’s a bit harsh, but still! Somewhere between the second dramatic monologue and the third explosion, I started to wonder if I’d left the stove on at home. But then there was that scene where the protagonist just stands there staring down the mountain like it's an ex-lover. Oh boy, was I invested then.

The visuals are like, off-the-wall insane but also strangely mundane in parts? At one point, I thought I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a screensaver. But hey, a pretty cool screensaver you wouldn't mind 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨. Don't even get me started on the music — think Beethoven mixed with an off-brand karaoke machine. Oddly fitting?

> And what was up with that side character, the one who kept talking about potatoes? Are potatoes the new metaphor for existential crisis? Someone explain this to me later or just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 for yourself. Maybe I missed the memo.

But, uh, if I were to give some credit, I sorta liked how the mountain seemed almost alive, like an ancient grumpy turtle pretending it wasn't soaking up all the attention. I'm still thinkin’ about that turtle.

Random moment of genius here: 
```javascript
function climbMountPain(allThePain) { 
  return allThePain  Math.random(); 
}
```

Walked out of there both amazed and, let’s be real, a touch confused. Questioning my life choices now. Like why did I decide to binge-eat nachos right before this? Whatever, it was a ride. Definitely a weird evening, but sometimes you need a little weird, ya know? Keeps life from turning into just a boring ol’   reel.
